Epic and User Story

      An epic captures a large body of work. 
      It is essentially a large user story that can be broken down into a number of smaller stories. 
      It may take several sprints to complete an epic. 

      A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to 
          capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. 
      The user story describes the type of user, what they want and why. 
      A user story helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.
      e.g. As a XYZ, I want to do X-thing, so that I can see Y-thing.
